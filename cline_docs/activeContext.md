# Active Context

## Current Focus
- Initial project setup and repository initialization
- Setting up Supabase local development environment
- Establishing basic project structure for Noodle Seed's backend services
- Configuring development environment for AI-driven microservices

## Recent Changes
- Initialized git repository and pushed to GitHub (noodleseed-com/noodle-python-apis)
- Created .gitignore file for Python projects and excluded Cline documentation
- Established documentation structure
- Created initial product context documentation
- Updated technical architecture to use Supabase
- Set up basic FastAPI application with health check endpoint
- Created comprehensive README with Supabase integration details

## Next Steps
1. Set up local Supabase development environment:
   - Start Supabase services
   - Configure authentication providers
   - Set up initial database schema
   - Define Row Level Security policies

2. Integrate FastAPI with Supabase:
   - Add Supabase client configuration
   - Implement authentication middleware
   - Set up database connection
   - Configure real-time subscriptions

3. Set up project structure for microservices:
   - SeedSpec processing service with Supabase Edge Functions
   - AI model orchestration service
   - Project management service with real-time features
   - Code generation service with storage integration

3. Initialize Python virtual environment and dependencies:
   - FastAPI for RESTful APIs
   - PyTorch/TensorFlow for AI model integration
   - Supabase Python client
   - Pydantic for data validation

4. Configure Supabase integrations:
   - Set up authentication flows
   - Configure storage buckets
   - Implement real-time subscriptions
   - Deploy initial Edge Functions

5. Create initial API documentation using OpenAPI/Swagger
6. Implement basic health check endpoints
7. Set up CI/CD pipeline configuration
