# System Patterns

## Architecture
- Microservices-based architecture for scalability and maintainability
- Event-driven communication between services
- RESTful API design principles
- Service mesh for inter-service communication
- Container orchestration ready

## Technical Decisions
- Python as primary backend language
  - FastAPI for high-performance async APIs
  - PyTorch/TensorFlow for AI model integration
  - Pydantic for data validation
- Supabase for core infrastructure
  - PostgreSQL with Row Level Security (RLS)
  - Built-in authentication and authorization
  - Real-time subscriptions
  - Object storage
  - Edge Functions for serverless compute
- Docker for containerization
- Kubernetes for orchestration
- Redis for additional caching
- RabbitMQ/Kafka for event messaging

## Design Patterns
- Repository pattern for data access
- Factory pattern for AI model creation
- Strategy pattern for different AI model implementations
- Observer pattern for event handling
- Command pattern for task processing
- Circuit breaker for external service calls
- CQRS for complex data operations
- Saga pattern for distributed transactions

## Service Boundaries
- Each microservice:
  - Has its own database
  - Is independently deployable
  - Has clear domain boundaries
  - Follows single responsibility principle
  - Implements its own data validation
  - Handles its own logging and monitoring

## Security Patterns
- Supabase Authentication
  - JWT tokens with Row Level Security
  - OAuth2 providers integration
  - Email/password and magic link auth
- Database Security
  - Row Level Security (RLS) policies
  - Database roles and permissions
  - Secure connection pooling
- API Security
  - Rate limiting
  - Input validation
  - API versioning
  - Secure headers
  - CORS policies
