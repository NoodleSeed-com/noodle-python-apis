# System Patterns

## Architecture
- Microservices-based architecture for scalability and maintainability
- Event-driven communication between services
- RESTful API design principles
- Service mesh for inter-service communication
- Container orchestration ready

## Technical Decisions
- Python as primary backend language
  - FastAPI for high-performance async APIs
  - PyTorch/TensorFlow for AI model integration
  - SQLAlchemy for ORM
  - Pydantic for data validation
- Docker for containerization
- Kubernetes for orchestration
- PostgreSQL for persistent storage
- Redis for caching and real-time features
- RabbitMQ/Kafka for event messaging

## Design Patterns
- Repository pattern for data access
- Factory pattern for AI model creation
- Strategy pattern for different AI model implementations
- Observer pattern for event handling
- Command pattern for task processing
- Circuit breaker for external service calls
- CQRS for complex data operations
- Saga pattern for distributed transactions

## Service Boundaries
- Each microservice:
  - Has its own database
  - Is independently deployable
  - Has clear domain boundaries
  - Follows single responsibility principle
  - Implements its own data validation
  - Handles its own logging and monitoring

## Security Patterns
- JWT for authentication
- OAuth2 for authorization
- Rate limiting
- Input validation
- API versioning
- Secure headers
- CORS policies
